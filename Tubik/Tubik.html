            <p>The details are not the details. They make the design,” Charles Eames once said, and that has never stopped to be true. Starting to design a web page, we have to consider what it should consist of to solve the task set for it and be both usable and beautiful. Our today’s article is devoted right to those vital details that create an effective web page. Let’s briefly review what elements can be essential for a typical web page, what impact each element has, and how it contributes to the general user experience. Packed with plenty of web design examples.</p>

            <!--HEADER-->
            <article>
                <h2>Header</h2>
                <p>Header is the upper (top) part of the webpage. Being the area people see before scrolling the page in their first seconds on the website, the header is an element of strategic importance. It is expected from the header to provide the core navigation around the website so that users could scan it in split seconds and jump to the main pages that can help them. Headers are also referred to as site menus and positioned as an element of primary navigation in the website layout.</p>
                <p>Headers may include a bunch of meaningful layout elements, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>basic elements of brand identity, usually a logo</li>
                    <li>call-to-action button</li>
                    <li>links to basic categories of website content</li>
                    <li>links to the social networks</li>
                    <li>basic contact information (telephone number, e-mail address, etc.)</li>
                    <li>switcher of the languages in case of the multilingual interface</li>
                    <li><a href="">search field</a></li>
                    <li>subscription field or button</li>
                    <li>links to interaction with the product such as trial version, downloading from the AppStore, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It doesn’t mean that all the mentioned elements should be included in one web page header:in this case, the header section would be overloaded with information. The more objects attract the user’s attention, the harder it is to concentrate on the vital ones. On the basis of design tasks, designers, sometimes together with marketing specialists, decide on the strategically important options and pick them up from the list or add the others.</p>
                
                <div>
                    <video src="" controls alt=""></video>
                    <p>Shipping company website uses the header zone effectively: it includes a company logo in the left corner and the prominent contrast call-to-action button in the right corner, also placing the links to core navigation in between. The header zone is clearly separated from the rest of the page by the horizontal line used as a visual divider.</p>
                </div>

                <p>What makes a header a vital element contributing to web usability is the fact that it is placed in the most scannable zone of a web page. Whatever is the scanning pattern users stick to on a website, it starts from the top part of the page, scanned from left to right for languages using the same reading and writing pattern. It means that what is placed in the header won’t be missed, especially the elements placed in its left and right corners. That’s why you will often find the main CTA button in one of them. What’s more, the power of habit and the idea of external consistency of user experience should also be taken into account here. For years so far, visitors have been used to finding core navigation in headers, so mostly, the main question is to decide what to put into it rather than to use a header or not.</p>
                <p>Some of the popular design practices for web headers include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>hamburger menu: hiding the set of links to different pages or sections behind the hamburger button called so as it consists of horizontal lines looking like a typical bread-meat-bread hamburger.</li>
                        <li>sticky header: header that doesn’t hide away but sticks to the top part of the page when users are scrolling the page down. This way core navigation area is available at any point of interaction, which can be helpful in terms of content-heavy pages with long scrolling.</li>
                        <li>two-layer navigation: a sort of double set of navigation sites in the header to separate two different routes of navigation that are both important for web usability.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>One more widely-used pattern for website headers is making a logo clickable and opening or refreshing the home page after it’s clicked.</p>

                    <p><a href="">Bennett Tea</a> website uses a stylish and minimalist sticky header</p>
                </div>

            <!--CTA BUTTON-->
            <article>
                <h2>CTA Button</h2>
                <p>A <a href="">call-to-action (CTA) button</a> is an element of a user interface aimed at encouraging a user to take a certain action.</p>
                <p>Effective call-to-action buttons are easy to notice; designers intentionally create them so that website visitors could see them in split seconds and respond.</p>

                <div>
                    <img src="" alt="CTA Button Example">
                    <p>About page for <a href="">ShipDaddy website</a> is a good example of the call-to-action element instantly noticeable in the general webpage layout.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <video src="" controls alt=""></video>
                    <p>The web page for <a href="">Mayple</a> is formed of several sections and uses a set of consistent call-to-action buttons for each combining them effectively with the same CTA in the header, </p>
                </div>

            </article>

            <!--HERO SECTION-->
            <article>
                <h2>Hero Section</h2>
                <p>Hero section is the above-the-fold pre-scroll area of the web page containing the element that presents the strong visual hook:</p>

                <div>
                    <video src="" controls alt=""></video>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <video src="" controls alt=""></video>
                    <p>Options for a hero section design on a landing page design for <a href="">Uni</a> fintech service</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <video src="" controls alt=""></video>
